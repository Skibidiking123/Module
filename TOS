Upon execution, your membershiptype, username, userid, executor, money will be logged as well as being forced to join my discord server if you have the discord app.
Your data will only be seen by me for analytics such as checking my demographic and more. I will not sell your data to any 3rd party company nor sell your information to the devs.
When having the webhook function enabled and hatching an egg, your hatch info such as the pet type, base weight and rarity will be sent through my bot into my discord where everyone can view it publicly. In addition to this, half of your username(ex: blackhub = blac**) will be included in the hatch data
I can choose to change the terms of service at any point.
