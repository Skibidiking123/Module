Upon execution, your membershiptype, username, userid, executor, money will be logged as well as being forced to join my discord server if you have the discord app.
Your data will only be seen by me for analytics such as checking my demographic and more. I will not sell your data to any 3rd party company nor sell your information to the devs.
I can choose to change the terms of service at any point.
